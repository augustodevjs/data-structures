# Basic of Asymptotic Analysis

### Efficiency

- Efficiency of data structures is always measured in terms of time and space.
- An ideal data structure could be the one that takes the least possible time for all its operations and cosumes the least memory
- Our focus will be on finding the TIME COMPLEXITY

### Finding F(N)

- We can compare two data structures for a particular operation by comparing their f(n) values.
- We are interested in growth rate of f(n) with respect to n because it might be possible that for smaller input size, one data structure may seem better than the other for largefr input size it may not.
- This concept is applicable in comparing the two data structures as well.
- This approximate measure of time complexity is called Asymptotic Complexity
