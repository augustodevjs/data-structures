### What is a Data Structure?

- A data structure is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

### What is a Data Type?

Two important things about data types:

- Defines a certain domain of values.
- Defines operations allowed on those values.

Example:

`int type`

- Takes only integer values
- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, bitwise operations etc.

### What is Abstract Data Types (ADT)?

- ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using fucntions without specifying what is there inside the function and how the operations are perfomed.

Example:

Stack ADT

- A stack consists of elements of same type arranged in a sequential order.

Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type from the user.

### Types of Data Structures:

- Linear Data Structures

  - A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear (sequential) order.
  - Examples: Array, Queue, Linked List, Stacks

- Nonlinear Data Structures

  - A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear (sequential) order. There is no linear arrangement of the elements.
  - Exemaples: Tree, Graph

- Static Data Structures

  - In these tpye of data structures, the memory is allocated at compile time. Therefore, maximum size is fixed.
  - Advantage: Fast Acess
  - Disadvantage: Slower insertion and deletion

- Dynamic Data Structures
  - In these types of data structures, the memory is allocated at run time. Therefore maximum size is flexible.
  - Advantage: Faster insertion and deleton
  - Disadvantage: Slower access
